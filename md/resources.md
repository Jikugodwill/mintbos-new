## Tools

#### Get your picks and shovels here

- [bos-loader](https://github.com/near/bos-loader/tree/main)

- Serves a local directory of component files as a JSON payload properly formatted to be plugged into a BOS `redirectMap`. When paired with a viewer configured to call out to this loader, it enables local component developmentâ€”especially when working on multiple components in parallel.

- [bos-cli-rs](https://github.com/bos-cli-rs/bos-cli-rs)

- Component syncing and CI/CD. Ability to download and deploy widgets, as well as make calls to the social contract.

- [bos-component-ts-starter](https://github.com/frol/bos-component-ts-starter/blob/main/README.md)

- Transpiles TSX to JSX using sucrase. Also, automatically returns the `export default function` as BOS component, so you don't need to have a free-standing `return <MyComponent props={props} />` statement at the end of your file.

- [bos-workspace](https://github.com/NEARBuilders/bos-workspace)

- like bos-loader, but more feature-rich. Starts a local gateway, supports Typescript (instead of ts-starter), has hot reload, local widget development in favorite text editor.

### Getting started with bos-workspace

Install [create-bos-app](https://github.com/archetype-org/create-bos-app)

```cmd

pnpm add -g @archetype-org/create-bos-app

```

After installing, run the CLI to start your app, switch to the app directory, and start up the dev environment

```cmd

create-bos-app

cd app

yarn dev

```

Note: bos-workspace has a new version coming out.

Feedback wanted on [bos-workspace v1](https://github.com/NEARBuilders/bos-workspace/pull/51). This will combine `create-bos-app` and `bos-workspace`.
